  body: 'Haml overrides various ActionView helpers, which call an #is_haml? method
    to determine whether or not the current context object is a proper Haml context.
    Because ActionView helpers may be included in non-ActionView::Base classes, it''s
    a good idea to define is_haml? for all objects.'
